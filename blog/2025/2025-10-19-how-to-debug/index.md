# introduction

imagine you're sitting at your computer, writing some code. it's really cool code and oyu like it a lot. you finish it up, compile it, run it, and....... your code doesn't work. maybe it crashes, maybe you have a black screen, maybe you just don't get the result you want

you're not alone. this syndrome affects every single programmer at one time or another - from the script kiddie writing her first lines of python to the ancient c programmer who'd rather be using assembly. bugs affect us all, and getting rid of them is not easy

in this article i'll walk you through how you can go about solving some bugs. i'll show you some of the tools the experts use to isolate bugs, how to step through your code and find out what's going wrong, and how to fix it and make your application awesome

# step 1: encounter a bug

before you can solve a bug, you must have a bug to solve

# step 2: idenfity what is breaking

# step 3: find the code that contributes to that thing

# step 4: check that this code is correct

# step 5: repeat step 3 and 4 until you find a problem

# step 6: verify the fix

# step 7: bask in your glory

# conclusion

and that's it! you can apply this process to any bug you encounter. some bugs require digging really deep into the code your'e using, and other bugs are as simple as a missing minus sign. however different they may seem, all bugs are united in one aspect: you can solve them
